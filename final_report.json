        "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz has been experiencing a meteoric rise in the tennis world, but there are several risk factors to consider for his upcoming performances. Firstly, as a young player, his ranking and lack of experience compared to seasoned opponents can be a potential disadvantage. Top-tier competitors may exploit his relative inexperience, particularly in high-pressure situations such as Grand Slams.\n\nMoreover, any recent injuries could hinder his performance. Tennis is demanding physically, and even minor injuries can impede movement and endurance on the court. Keeping track of his health updates is crucial, as past ankle or wrist issues might resurface, affecting his play.\n\nAnother aspect is coaching stability. While a strong coaching team can provide strategic and psychological support, any changes or uncertainties in this area could impact his mental preparedness and adaptability during matches. Monitoring his rapport with his coaching staff may provide insights into his readiness and confidence levels. Overall, while Alcaraz is promising, these factors should be carefully scrutinized for an accurate risk assessment."
